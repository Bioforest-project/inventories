# Introduction

-   what this code and document is for

-   how to use it

-   checklist of you need to do before running the script:

    -   sign the data agreement

    -   harmonize your dataset

    - send species list (should already be ok)

-   add plot-level information in this [document](google doc)

# Check data consistency

## All DBH above DBH cutoff and no NA values

## No tree ID duplicates

## Only one species per tree

## Only one set of coordinates per tree

## All trees within the plot


# First step of data visualization

- stem abundance by plot and census year

- mean (or median) dbh by plot and census year

- number of species

# DBH corrections

flowchart

# Biodiversity metrics

# Aboveground biomass
